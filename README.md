# Why
I cloned this repo to learn about how to code in js and how to code a zotero plugin. I could learn:
## how to organize the code into a structured way
## a typical code structure of boostrap.js which is the entry point of zeotero plugin
## how to add,edit,update a menuitem and its listerner in a Z6 and Z7 compatible manner
## how to use Pool/async feature to make the code more effcient
Many thanks to the author!
